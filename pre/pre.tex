    \frametitle{Classic Generalized Steiner Tree problem}
    In the classic generalized Steiner tree, we are given an undirected graph \(G\) with non-negative edge costs and a set of terminals. The goal is find the a subgraph of \(G\) that connects all terminals and minimizes the cost.

    However, when players start to have self-interests, some players might need to pay more if they choose to discard self-interests to archive best centralized optimum. 

Given an undirected graph \(G\) with non-negative edge costs and \(N\) players, each player is interested in connecting a set of terminals ( nodes in \(G\) ) via buying a subgraph of \(G\). Players offer each edge in \(G\) certain amount of money and they would like to pay a little as possible.
